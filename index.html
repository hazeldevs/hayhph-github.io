			<p> &emsp; &emsp; Mr. Hayhurst, your classes were always engaging and interesting. From the very beginning, you made sure that all the students that you taught
			were not only capable of learning, but also encouraged to ask questions. Your approach to teaching demonstrated a level of professionalism that I aspire to achieve
			one day. Having taken numerous classes of yours across multiple years during my time at Ridgeview, I can be proud to say that the classes that you offered were 
			some of the best science classes I could have asked for.</p>
